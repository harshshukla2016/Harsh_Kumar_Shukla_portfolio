> *"A futuristic, interactive, and high-performance developer portfolio built with the modern web stack."*

## 🚀 **Overview**

This portfolio is a showcase of my work as an **SAP SD Consultant** and **Software Engineer**. It is designed not just to display information, but to provide an immersive user experience through 3D graphics, smooth animations, and a responsive, mobile-first interface.

The core design philosophy is **"Midnight & Electric Blue"**—a dark, cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic with neon accents and glassmorphism effects.

## ✨ **Key Features**

### 🌌 **Interactive 3D Universe**
-   **Star Explosion Engine**: Click anywhere on the hero background to trigger a custom particle system explosion.
-   **Optimized Rendering**: Uses instanced geometry to render thousands of stars and particles at 60 FPS.
-   **Dynamic Lighting**: Real-time lighting effects powered by `@react-three/fiber`.

### 📱 **Mobile-First Design**
-   **Adaptive Navigation**: 
    -   Desktop: Clean top-bar navigation with social links.
    -   Mobile: Custom hamburger menu with a unique **animated profile logo** that transitions from a large centered showcase to a compact sticky header element on scroll.
-   **Responsive Layouts**: Content reflows seamlessly from multi-column grids to vertical stacks.

### 🎨 **Aesthetic UI/UX**
-   **Glassmorphism**: Frosted glass effects on navigation bars and cards.
-   **Neon Glows**: Custom CSS box-shadows and text-shadows for a vibrant feel.
-   **Smooth Transitions**: Powered by `framer-motion` for buttery smooth entry and scroll animations.
